# LORApp
This web app was created for the "Riot Games Developer Challenge" for their game called "Legends of Runeterra" using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the front-end and Node.js/Express for the back-end. This is currently a snippet of the full project since I plan on hosting this web app on a domain once the API is released and don't want to reveal the server code. However, there is some starter server code for the project for those that are interested. There is filler content in place of where the API endpoint response content would be placed. 

# Personal use
This  open-source starter code can be used by anyone to create any project of their own since what is shown is a very bare version of what will be the final product which will be dramatically different. The variable called "API_KEY" will be left empty in the code to be filled in by your own API key.
